PROJECT #1: FLARF WEBSITE

Read K. Silem Mohammad's "Spooked and Considering How Spooky Deer Are." Consider what "uncreative writing" means, the rules of "flarf," and how it may be considered a type of generative web art. What kinds of webpages could be produced using randomized rules such as these?

Create a flarf poem based on these rules:

1) Do a google search of the last phrase you texted someone. (Make sure it is more than one wordâ€”if your last text was something like "k" or "lol," check to see what your next-to-last text was, etc.)
2) Paste the text result into a text editor (like Atom, Sublime, Vim, Emacs, etc.), and cut and edit that phrase as you like. (Don't forget a title.)
3) Use that same Google search, and download 4 images (or more) from the first page of image results. Include them in an "img" folder.
4) Use that text and those images to create a flarf poem website page. Include a CSS page to style it any way you like. (Check out the "weird webpages" resource list for inspiration, as well as HTML & CSS tutorials.)
5) Repeat this process at least 3 more times. You should have a website with at least 4 linked pages.
6) Upload the site to Github, and make it available using github pages.
